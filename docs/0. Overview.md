# Oilfield Data Management System

This project is designed to track and analyze oilfield operations by integrating diverse datasets—from well production and drilling records to GIS and seismic data. The goal is to enable informed decision-making for both operational management and strategic planning, ensuring a comprehensive view of oilfield performance and asset status.

---

## Workflow & Data Pipeline

The data pipeline consists of several stages that convert raw data into actionable insights:

1. **Data Ingestion & Preprocessing**

   - **Data Conversion:** CSV files are converted into GeoDataFrames.
   - **Spatial Standardization:** All layers are reprojected to a common coordinate system (EPSG:4326/3857) to ensure consistency.
   - **Data Cleaning:** Null values, duplicates, and outliers are removed or corrected.

2. **Database Design & Storage**

   - **Normalization:** Data is normalized into dedicated tables for wells, production, drilling, and reserves.
   - **Spatial Databases:** Geospatial data is stored in **PostGIS** or using **GeoParquet** for efficient spatial queries.

3. **ETL & Workflow Automation**

   - **ETL Frameworks:** Tools like **Apache Airflow** or **Prefect** schedule and monitor data ingestion, transformation, and syncing with field reports or partner APIs.
   - **Versioning:** Large datasets are versioned with **DVC** or **Git LFS**.

4. **Visualization & Mapping**
   - **Mapping:** Maps are created using **GeoPandas**, **Folium**, or **Leaflet** to visualize well statuses, drilling evolution, production heat maps, and reserve distributions.
   - **Interactive Dashboards:** Interactive visualizations are built with **Plotly**, **Bokeh**, or web frameworks like **Dash** and **Streamlit**.

## Ingestion & Cataloging

A dedicated ingestion module (`utils/ingest.py`) is responsible for:

- **Recursive File Discovery:**  
  Scanning `ArgGIS/data/raw` using Python’s `pathlib` and `glob` to list all datasets.
- **Specialized Loaders:**
  - **CSV Loader:** Uses `pandas.read_csv` with robust error handling.
  - **Excel Loader:** Leverages `openpyxl`/`xlrd` with custom header detection and table tidying functions.
  - **Spatial Data Loader:** Uses `geopandas.read_file` for shapefiles and DBF formats.
- **Validation:**  
  Ensures that each dataset meets minimal schema requirements (e.g., required columns, valid geometries).

- **Data Catalog:**  
  Stores each dataset along with its metadata (source path, file type, row/column counts) in a central catalog object, making it accessible for further processing.

---

## Data Transformation & Integration

After ingestion, the pipeline applies normalization and integration routines:

- **Column & Data Normalization:**  
  Functions like `clean_column_names()` and `smart_type_converter()` standardize all datasets.
- **Unique Identifiers:**  
  Generate or map unique IDs for entities to allow seamless joins between datasets (e.g., linking well production history with well locations).
- **Schema Unification:**  
  Define a comprehensive schema to integrate administrative, drilling, forecast, geographical, production, reserves, reservoir, seismic, and well data.
- **ETL Workflows:**  
  Use automation tools (e.g., Apache Airflow or Prefect) to schedule daily/weekly data ingestion and transformation jobs.

---

## Visualization & Mapping

The unified data is then used for interactive mapping and visualization:

- **Well Status Maps:**  
  Visualize well locations and statuses using **GeoPandas** and **Folium/Leaflet**.
- **Production Heat Maps:**  
  Aggregate production data into grids (hexbin or square) and visualize intensities with **Plotly Choropleths** or **Deck.gl**.
- **Drilling Evolution:**  
  Use time sliders or animations (via Plotly or Bokeh) to show drilling activity over time.
- **Reserve Distribution Maps:**  
  Overlay reserves data on basin polygons with graduated symbols or choropleth maps.

Additionally, web dashboards can be built using **Dash**, **Streamlit**, or **Panel** for real-time data exploration.

---

## Tech Stack & Environment

**Core Technologies:**

- **Python 3.11+**
- **Pandas**, **GeoPandas**, **Shapely**, **Fiona**, **Pyproj**, **openpyxl**
- **Plotly**, **Bokeh**, **Folium/Leaflet**
- **Docker**, **Poetry** (for reproducible environments)
- **DVC/Git LFS** (for versioning large datasets)

**Optional Enhancements:**

- **PostGIS** or **GeoParquet** for spatial database storage
- **Contextily** for ESRI/Mapbox basemaps
- **FastAPI** for RESTful services

---

## Interactive Exploration

The `explore.ipynb` notebook provides an interactive environment to:

- Load and profile all ingested datasets.
- Visualize sample records, generate Pandas Profiling or Sweetviz reports.
- Experiment with data joins, schema designs, and transformation routines.
- Document insights and refine the unified data schema before full pipeline deployment.
